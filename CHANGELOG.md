## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

**Agent definitions and worktree isolation (Phase 18–19)**
- `AgentDef.isolation = "worktree"` — `devagent agent run` creates a fresh git worktree for an agent and cleans it up when done; prevents concurrent agents from clobbering each other's edits
- `devagent init-project --generate` — LLM analyses `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, and directory layout to write a project-specific `DEVAGENT.md`; falls back to a static template if the LLM is offline
- `load_devagent_md()` now walks ancestor directories (outermost first) so nested projects inherit parent-level instructions

**Per-agent persistent memory (Phase 20)**
- `AgentDef.memory = "project"` wires `.devagent/agent-memory/<name>/memory.md` — the agent reads it at start and writes to it via the `remember_persistent` tool; survives between invocations

**HTTP and prompt hook types (Phase 21)**
- New hook types: `http` (POST JSON to an external endpoint) and `prompt` (inject text into the next LLM call)
- Lifecycle events `session_start` and `session_end` now fire for all hook types, not just `shell`
- `devagent hooks test <event> <tool>` — dry-run any hook without starting a full session

**Structured output flag (Phase 22)**
- `devagent do "<task>" --json-schema '<schema>'` — validates `FinalAnswerEvent.text` against a JSON Schema; retries once with an augmented prompt on mismatch; exits with code 2 if the second attempt still fails
- Requires `jsonschema>=4.0.0` (added as a dependency)

**`/model` mid-session switch (Phase 23)**
- `/model <provider/model>` inside `devagent run` hot-swaps the active LLM for the rest of the session without restarting
- `/model <model>` (no slash) keeps the current provider and changes only the model name
- Validates provider names; supported: `ollama`, `anthropic`, `openai`, `gemini`, `groq`

**`autofix-pr` watch mode (Phase 24)**
- `devagent autofix-pr <pr-url>` — polls a PR every N seconds (default 120); on each new failed CI run, fetches job logs and fires a `DevAgentSession` to fix and push; on each new review comment, fires a session to address it
- `--poll-interval` and `--max-polls` flags for CI usage
- Existing failures and comments at startup are seeded into `seen` sets so they are not re-processed

**`@agent-name` REPL mention syntax (Phase 25)**
- `@code-reviewer please check the auth changes` inside `devagent run` spawns the named agent as a background daemon thread; progress is tracked via the task store
- Respects `AgentDef.isolation = "worktree"` for isolated execution
- Use `/tasks` to check status; agents are looked up from `.devagent/agents/*.toml` and the user config dir

**Plugin bundle format (Phase 26)**
- `PluginBundle` dataclass — third-party packages declare tools, skills, hooks, and MCP servers via the `devagent.plugins` entry-point group in their `pyproject.toml`
- `devagent plugins list` — discovers and renders all installed plugin bundles in a table
- `devagent plugins install <package>` — wraps `pip install` and reports success/failure
- `devagent tasks` — list all background agent tasks in the current process (running, done, failed)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added
- 24-task benchmark set covering Python (20), JavaScript (2), and Go (2) fixture projects
- JS fixture project (`js_project/`) with `add-feature-001` and `test-write-js-001` tasks
- Go fixture project (`go_project/`) with `add-feature-go-001` and `test-write-go-001` tasks
- `devagent bench leaderboard` command — groups results by (model, provider), shows best and latest score
- `devagent bench leaderboard --remote` — fetches results from `bench-results` git branch
- `devagent bench leaderboard --output <file>` — writes markdown leaderboard to a file
- `LEADERBOARD.md` seeded with live benchmark scores (gpt-oss:20b: 21/24, llama3.2:3b: 9/20)
- CI auto-update step in `bench-persist.yml`: regenerates `LEADERBOARD.md` on main after every push
- `devagent bench history --remote` flag for fetching result files from the `bench-results` branch
- Go binary validation in canary workflow (ensures Go fixtures compile before running)
- Native dry-run results persisted to `bench-results` branch alongside canary JSON
- Multi-task `-t` flag (repeatable): `devagent bench native -t bug-fix-001 -t refactor-002`
- Model/provider metadata embedded in saved benchmark JSON files for leaderboard tracking

### Fixed
- `code-review-001`: raised `timeout_sec` from 60 → 120 to prevent API call timeouts
- `refactor-002`: removed false task description premise ("multiply bug is already fixed"); agent now runs pytest first to discover and fix failures before adding type hints
- `test-write-002`: added explicit import pattern, "run each function via shell to verify expected values before writing assertions", and raised `timeout_sec` to 300
- Multi-task `-t` flag: switched from `str | None` to `list[str] | None` so multiple `-t` values accumulate correctly
- Unicode check marks in canary output replaced with ASCII for cross-platform terminal compatibility

### Changed
- Benchmark result JSON format extended: `{"meta": {...}, "results": [...]}` envelope (backward compatible with old plain-list format)
- `BenchReport.save_json` accepts optional `model` and `provider` parameters
- `BenchReport.render_leaderboard` and `generate_leaderboard_md` added to `report.py`

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- `INTEGRATIONS.md` — setup guides for Claude Code, ChatGPT, Antigravity, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, JetBrains, Zed
- `BENCHMARKS.md` — full benchmark documentation with per-task results table
- Ollama Cloud provider support (`gpt-oss:20b`, `nemotron-3-nano:30b`, `gemma4:31b`, 15+ hosted models)
- First live 20-task benchmark run: gpt-oss:20b scored 20/20 (100%)
- B4 cost-to-correctness sweep infrastructure: `devagent bench sweep` with parameter grid
- `devagent bench history` command for cross-run trend comparison
- `expected_files_touched` enforcement in benchmark runner — reports files missed or extra
- Syntax checking for `.py` files written during benchmark runs (auto-surfaces errors to model)
- Token-savings measurement in `bench_token_usage.py` using real CodePrism graph queries
- Real `call_count` tracking for iteration counting in live benchmark runs
- Phases 10–14: hooks infrastructure, permission modes, REPL UX improvements, agent definition files

### Fixed
- Removed `--skip-legacy` from CI — all legacy benchmark scripts pass reliably
- Benchmark oracle fixes: `DEVAGENT_OUTPUT.txt` auto-write, syntax check, task-id filter

### Changed
- README overhauled to match the full current feature set (Phases 1–16 complete)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-13

- Watcher storage, scheduler, and reporting flow for recurring repository health checks
- Cross-issue conflict detection to flag files touched by multiple open issues
- Watcher-specific terminal rendering for watched repos, health reports, and stored analyses

### Changed
- GitHub client now supports listing repository issues for watcher checks
- Configuration now includes watcher defaults such as interval, labels, and cross-conflict behavior
- Added `apscheduler` runtime support and enabled automatic asyncio handling for pytest

### Fixed
- Added watcher-focused tests covering conflict detection, analysis building, and watcher storage
